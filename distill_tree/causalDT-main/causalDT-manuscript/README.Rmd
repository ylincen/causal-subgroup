# Causal Distillation Trees

[Causal Distillation Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07275) (CDT) is a novel machine learning method for estimating interpretable subgroups in causal inference. CDT allows researchers to fit *any* machine learning model of their choice to estimate the individual-level treatment effect, and then leverages a simple, second-stage tree-based model to "distill" the estimated treatment effect into meaningful subgroups. As a result, CDT inherits the improvements in predictive performance from black-box machine learning models while preserving the interpretability of a simple decision tree.

Briefly, CDT is a two-stage learner that first fits a teacher model (e.g., a black-box metalearner) to estimate individual-level treatment effects and secondly fits a student model (e.g., a decision tree) to predict the estimated individual-level treatment effects, in effect distilling the estimated individual-level treatment effects and producing interpretable subgroups. This two-stage learner is learned using the training data. Finally, using the estimated subgroups, the subgroup average treatment effects are honestly estimated with a held-out estimation set.

## Project Structure

This directory contains all of the code necessary to reproduce the analysis and figures in [Huang et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07275).

Moreover, to facilitate reproducibility of this work, we leveraged [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to create a reproducible environment and [`simChef`](https://yu-group.github.io/simChef/) to create a reproducible and transparent simulation workflow. Thus, to install the necessary dependencies and reproduce the simulation, the following steps are recommended:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `causalDT-manuscript.Rproj` in RStudio.
3. Run the following code in the R console:

```r
# install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

4. Run each of the simulation driver scripts in the `meals/` directory.
5. Render all of the results into a single summary `simChef` documentation by running the `meals/00_render_docs.R` script.

These steps will generate all of the figures and results from the mansucript. The rendered `simChef` documentation can be found [here](https://tiffanymtang.github.io/causalDT/simulation_results.html).
