Summary: 
- Our method is implemented in R. For the baselines we compared, some are in R 
and others are in Python. 
- It is very difficult to use a single enviroment and the packages may conflict. 
It is hence highly recommend to use the "renv" to manage R packages for each 
single algorithm, and conda or another tools to manage the python environent.

- When we run the baselines, we either use the source code released by the authors, 
or directly use Python/R packages that implemented these algorithms. 
For all baselines, the main scripts for running our experiments are named as
  run_synthetic.R (or .py)
  run_semi.R (or. py)

R version: 
- 4.2.1; 
- OS tested: macOS and Linux; 

R Packages required: 
1) for simulation of semi-synethetic datasets:
- dplyr
- data.table
- remotes
- install the simulator by using remotes::install_github("vdorie/aciccomp/2016")

2) for run the code for OUR proposed method
- rpart
- rpart.plot

3) for QUINT
- quint (and its dependencies below)
- partykit
- grid
- libcoin
- mvtnorm
- Formula
- See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quint/index.html for the full list of dependencies. 

4) for Virtual Twins
- aVirtualTwins (and all dependencies specified in its document)
- See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aVirtualTwins/index.html; 

5) for SIDES
- rsides (and all dependencies specified in its document)
- See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rsides/ for the full list of dependencies.

6) for Causal Tree
- causalTree (and all dependencies specified in its document)
- See https://github.com/susanathey/causalTree for dependencies. 

7) for Distill Tree
- The source code is released at https://tiffanymtang.github.io/causalDT/index.html;
its installation instructions are provided as follows:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tiffanymtang/causalDT", subdir = "causalDT").

However, I cannot figure out how to resolve the errors in installing this package, 
and hence I work with the source code directly. The source code is in the
folder "./causalDT-main/"

Further, the following packages are required to run the code for Distill Tree:
- rpart
- rpart.plot
- purrr
- R.utils
- grf

8) Interaction Tree
- This R package is not available on CRAN, and the source code is released by the author. 
- See https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XUIWapeSE3m5VdteTxmyYgSP3A3eeNy4/view; 
- The implementation is in Functions-IT.R. 


Python baseline: 
- CURLS: we directly work with the source code released from the original author. 
- Depending on the settings, you might need to add the following at the beginning of the code:
sys.path.append('./CURLS/osfstorage-archive/')
sys.path.append('./CURLS/osfstorage-archive/pipeline/')


- The dependencies can be found at: https://osf.io/zwp2k/
- Note that CURLS is quite slow (we had to use linux servers to run the experiments in parrallel.)

- the main code can be found in the folder "./curls/osfstorage-archive/pipeline/"
- the requirements.txt in curls/osfstorage-archive/ is the requirement file from the original authors. We also export our pip installed packages in the file 
"curls/osfstorage-archive/pipeline/our_requirements.txt"

- For the semi-synthetic datasets, you can run the code by using the command:
python run_semi.py
or, you can also fully specify the path for the semi-synthetic dataset by
python run_semi.py --data_path ../../../datasets/semi_synthetic/ACIC2016_1.csv

- Similarly, for the synthetic datasets, you can run the code by
python run_synthetic.py, or
python run_synthetic.py --data_path ../../../datasets/synthetic/simulate1/n_1000_iter_1.csv
