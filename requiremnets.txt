Summary: 
- Our method is implemented in R. For the baselines we compared, some are in R 
and others are in Python. 
- It is very difficult to use a single enviroment and the packages may conflict. 
It is hence highly recommend to use the "renv" to manage R packages for each 
single algorithm, and conda or another tools to manage the python environent.


R version: 
- 4.2.1; 
- OS tested: macOS and Linux; 

R Packages required: 
1) for simulation of semi-synethetic datasets:
- dplyr
- data.table
- remotes
- install the simulator by using remotes::install_github("vdorie/aciccomp/2016")

2) for run the code for OUR proposed method
- rpart
- rpart.plot

3) for QUINT
- quint (and its dependencies below, see the supplementary files for the link)
- partykit
- grid
- libcoin
- mvtnorm
- Formula

4) for Virtual Twins
- aVirtualTwins (and all dependencies specified in its document)

5) for SIDES
- rsides (and all dependencies specified in its document)

6) for Causal Tree
- causalTree (and all dependencies specified in its document)

7) for Distill Tree
- The source code is released at https://tiffanymtang.github.io/causalDT/index.html;
its installation instructions are provided as follows:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tiffanymtang/causalDT", subdir = "causalDT").

However, I cannot figure out how to resolve the errors in installing this package, 
and hence I work with the source code directly. The source code is in the
folder "./causalDT-main/"

Further, the following packages are required to run the code for Distill Tree:
- rpart
- rpart.plot
- purrr
- R.utils
- grf
